<h1>Hello.</h1>
<p>Here are some projects!</p>

<h2><a href='mass-music-venues'>Massachusetts Music Venues</a></h2>
<p>Ongoing, self-imposed effort to add every music venue in Massachusetts (past and present) to Wikidata. This site is built with <a href='https://github.com/glaciers-in-archives/snowman'>Snowman</a>, a static site generator for SPARQL backends.</p>
<h2><a href='https://airtable.com/apppB29XJt75ZIUEu/shrtgMckHCMDqqK8d'>Boston-area Amateur Musical Ensembles</a></h2>
<p>At some point, I'll turn this into a legit site, I swear. For now, a potentially useful collection of information about community bands and orchestras around Boston.</p>
<h2><a href='https://shortparisiens.home.blog/'>Les Shortparisiens</a></h2>
<p>On hiatus&mdash;at some point, I want to move this off Wordpress! We'll see! Fan site for the band Shortparis, started when I was in library school and thinking a lot about fan archival practices thanks to <a href='https://archivaria.ca/index.php/archivaria/article/view/13642'>this 2018 article about the Tragically Hip</a> in <i>Archivaria</i> and also the Soviet rock underground (and also parallels between the 1980s and 2010s St. Petersburg music scenes...)</p>
<h2><a href='bg-in-boston'>BG in Boston</a></h2>
<p>Optimistically on hiatus, realistically&mdash;abandoned. A little research blog inspired by Larry Katzâ€™s <i>Boston Herald</i> interview with Boris Grebenshchikov in the summer of 1989. The third post, <a href='bg-in-boston/2022/05/27/boston-venues.html'>"Boston Music Scene Tangent: Adding Venues from the Phoenix to Wikidata"</a> is kind of what led to the Massachusetts Music Venues project.</p>
